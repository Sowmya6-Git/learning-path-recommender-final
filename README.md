LEARNING PATH RECOMMENDER

Introduction :

With the increasing availability of online learning resources, learners often face confusion about where to begin and how to move forward in a structured way.Many platforms offer the same learning sequence to all users, without considering their prior knowledge or learning pace.As a result, beginners may feel overwhelmed, while learners with some background may find the content repetitive.

The Learning Path Recommender is a web-based application that addresses this problem by generating personalized learning roadmaps based on a user’s experience level and preferred learning duration. Instead of following a fixed syllabus, users receive a customized plan that helps them learn in a more focused and efficient manner. The system also includes a basic assessment mechanism to evaluate existing knowledge before suggesting advanced topics, ensuring that learners progress at a comfortable and logical pace.

Problem Statement :

Most online learning platforms provide the same learning structure to all users, regardless of their background knowledge. Beginners often feel overloaded, while users with some prior knowledge feel the content is too basic.

This project addresses this gap by analyzing the learner’s experience level and providing a customized learning path that suits their comfort and understanding.

Objectives of the Project :

* To create a personalized learning roadmap for different users

* To reduce learning overload for beginners

* To assess basic knowledge before suggesting advanced topics

* To provide a simple and structured learning plan

* To design a clean and user-friendly interface

Scope of the Project :

The application currently supports multiple courses and provides:

* Beginner-level learning plans based on duration

* Basic knowledge assessment using quizzes

* Adaptive roadmap generation
  
The system can be extended to include more courses, deeper assessments, and progress tracking.

How the System Works :

1. The user enters their name and selects a course

2. The user chooses their experience level:

    Just starting

    Has some basic knowledge

3. Based on the selection:

    Beginners choose the number of days and receive a day-wise plan

    Users with basic knowledge take a short assessment

4. A personalized roadmap is generated and displayed

Quiz and Evaluation Logic :

Each course contains a small set of concept-based questions designed to test fundamental understanding.

* Good performance leads to advanced topics

* Average performance leads to a mixed roadmap

* Poor performance redirects to foundational topics

This ensures the learning path matches the learner’s actual skill level.


* Basic knowledge assessment using quizzes

* Adaptive roadmap generation
